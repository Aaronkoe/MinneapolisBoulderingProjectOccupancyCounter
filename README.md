# MinneapolisBoulderingProjectOccupancyCounter
A very simple Android app for viewing the current occupancy of Minneapolis Bouldering Project: https://minneapolisboulderingproject.com/

To build the app:

1. Clone the repository to your personal machine

2. Import the project with android studio

3. Ensure SDK 30.0.3 is installed with SDK Manager in the Tools tab in the upper left

4. Build to an apk via *Build* > *Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)* > *Build APK(s)

5. Open the directory the apk was built to, for me it was `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`

6. Transfer the file to your Android device

7. Install the apk using your Android file manager of choice. Tutorial if you get stuck: https://www.lifewire.com/install-apk-on-android-4177185
